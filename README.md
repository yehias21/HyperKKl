# HyperKKL

## Model
### Extended Idea
- We want to generalize for any kind of Input, Idea proposed:
    - If input is very complex in nature to be learned, take the spectral decomposition of it (e.g Fourier basis) 
### Baseline
## Data generation and creation
### Code Design
## Evaluation technique
### Uncertainity Quantification
### Hypothesis testing - Permutation test - Ablation study
## Implementation Timeline
### Steps
- [X] Generate the data as proposed
- [X] Develop the Hypernetwork model
- [ ] Finish the training loop
- [ ] Simulation
- [ ] Evaluation
- [ ] Iteration
### Refinement 
- [ ] Test code for each code part + visualization technique
- [ ] Refactoring
